## 📖 Overview

**EventPay** is a **Stripe-inspired payment backend system** focused on **correctness, reliability, and failure safety**.  
Instead of UI-heavy demos, EventPay models how **real fintech systems** are built and reasoned about.

The system demonstrates:
- Deterministic payment state transitions  
- Immutable, append-only event sourcing  
- Idempotent APIs for safe retries  
- Production-grade webhook delivery  
- Failure-first engineering and observability  

> This project is built to mirror **real-world payment infrastructure**, not toy examples.

---

## 🎯 Why EventPay Exists

Payment systems operate in unreliable environments:
- Network failures  
- Client retries  
- Partial database commits  
- Webhook endpoint downtime  

**EventPay guarantees correctness even under repeated failures.**

## ✨ Core Guarantees

| Guarantee | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Correct payment lifecycle | Strict Finite State Machine |
| Full audit trail | Immutable event store |
| Safe retries | Idempotency keys + request hashing |
| Webhook reliability | At-least-once delivery + retries |
| Failure tolerance | Retry queues + DLQ |
| Observability | Structured logs + metrics |

##  Key Features

---

###   Payment State Machine (FSM)

Payments follow a strict lifecycle:

INITIATED → AUTHORIZED → CAPTURED
↘ FAILED
CAPTURED → REFUNDED


**Rules**
- No skipped states  
- No backward transitions  
- One event = one state change  

Illegal transitions are explicitly rejected to ensure **financial correctness**.

---

###  Immutable Event Store (Event Sourcing)

All payment changes are stored as append-only events.
